## 3. Description

<!-- Please briefly describe the purpose of the new plugin or the updates made to the existing plugin -->

This submission updates the Mem0 Dify plugin to **v0.2.12** (self-hosted mode). Key changes are summarized below; detailed release notes and historical context are in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/beersoccer/mem0_dify_plugin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

### Key Updates

- **Dynamic Extraction Parameters**: Switched `extract_long_term_memory` inputs to `form: llm` so Dify workflows can bind system and upstream variables more reliably
- **Cohere SDK Dependency**: Bundled `cohere>=6.1.0` by default to reduce manual setup for Cohere reranker users
- **Documentation Refresh**: Updated README, CONFIG, changelog, and related release docs to reflect the new extraction parameter behavior and reranker setup guidance

All API keys and credentials are stored locally in the user's Dify instance configuration and are not shared with any third parties. The plugin only communicates with services configured by the user (their LLM, embedding, and database services).
