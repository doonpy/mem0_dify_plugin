# Mem0 Dify Plugin - Changelog

## Unreleased

---

## Version 0.2.12 (2026-04-16)

### ✨ Enhancements
- **Dynamic extraction tool parameters**:
  - Switched all `extract_long_term_memory` tool inputs to `form: llm` so Dify workflows can bind system variables and upstream node outputs more consistently
- **Bundled Cohere SDK support**:
  - Added `cohere>=6.1.0` to runtime dependencies so Cohere reranker setups work without extra manual installation

### 🛠️ Reliability & Compatibility
- **Older Dify editor compatibility**:
  - Reduced schema differences between extraction and other memory tools, improving variable-binding behavior on older Dify releases that handle `form: form` less reliably

### 🔧 Configuration / Defaults
- **Documentation refresh for reranker setup**:
  - Updated README and CONFIG guidance to clarify that cloud rerankers may require provider-specific SDKs, with Cohere documented explicitly

---

## Version 0.2.11 (2026-04-14)

### ✨ Enhancements
- **AsyncMemory initialization compatibility**:
  - Added a compatibility resolver around `AsyncMemory.from_config()` so the async client now supports both coroutine-returning and direct-instance mem0 implementations
- **Supported mem0 version range**:
  - Relaxed the plugin dependency declaration from a fixed pin to `mem0ai>=1.0.2,<=1.0.11`
  - Kept the current lockfile aligned on `1.0.2` while documenting the validated support range for future upgrades

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Async credential validation regression**:
  - Prevented `object AsyncMemory can't be used in 'await' expression` during `async_mode=true` provider credential validation on newer mem0 releases
  - Preserved the existing provider validation flow (`get_async_client(...).search(...)`) so runtime behavior stays unchanged outside initialization compatibility

### ✅ Tests
- Added unit coverage for:
  - async `AsyncMemory.from_config()` compatibility
  - sync `AsyncMemory.from_config()` compatibility
  - async provider credential validation routing

### 📚 Docs
- Updated release docs, configuration notes, privacy metadata, and submission template for v0.2.11

---

## Version 0.2.10 (2026-03-23)

### ✨ Enhancements
- **Score mode adaptation across vector backends**:
  - Added `utils/score_utils.py` to infer raw score semantics (`distance` vs `similarity`) from vector provider + metric settings
  - `normalize_search_results()` now outputs consistent `score` (0-1 similarity), `vector_distance`, and `rerank_score` fields
  - Sync/Async Mem0 clients cache and pass `score_mode` into search normalization for stable cross-backend behavior
- **Memory evolution & forgetting workflow**:
  - Added access-log managers (`utils/access_log.py`) and forgetting logic (`utils/memory_forgetting.py`) based on EWMA quality + Ebbinghaus retention
  - Added new `forget_memories` tool with `dry_run` support to preview deletions before execution
  - Added provider credentials: `memory_ttl_days` (optional hard memory TTL) and `checkpoint_ttl_days` (default 90)

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Checkpoint scope isolation consistency**:
  - Checkpoint loading now applies `agent_id=app_id` filtering in both sync and async managers, preventing cross-app checkpoint mixing for the same user
- **Timestamp robustness for retention checks**:
  - Added `days_since()` helper to safely parse ISO timestamps (including `Z` suffix / naive UTC), with defensive fallback for invalid values

### ✅ Tests
- Added comprehensive unit tests for:
  - score mode detection (`test_score_utils.py`)
  - search result normalization (`test_normalize_search_results.py`)
  - forgetting algorithm and retention decisions (`test_memory_forgetting.py`)

## Version 0.2.9 (2026-03-04)

### ⚡ Optimizations
- **Worker Pool concurrency for extraction**:
  - Replaced batch-based while loop with a sliding-window Semaphore + `asyncio.as_completed`; the Semaphore now acts as a true sliding window so a slow user no longer blocks the next one from starting (straggler problem eliminated)
  - Time budget check moved inside the Semaphore acquisition: new user work is prevented from starting past the deadline at user granularity, not batch granularity
  - Exceptions are captured inside each user coroutine and returned as ERROR results, removing raw exception propagation through `asyncio.gather`
  - Progress flushes to DB every N completions (same write frequency as the prior batch loop), but each user's result is aggregated immediately as it arrives

---

## Version 0.2.8 (2026-02-12)

### 🛡️ Stability Under Load
- **Pre-enqueue overload guard**:
  - Async operations reject early when pending tasks exceed threshold (prevents queue buildup and runaway CPU)
- **Safer defaults for production**:
  - Read timeout defaults to 5s; write timeout defaults to 15s; lower default concurrency and pgvector pool sizing

### 🧱 PGVector Robustness
- **Connection string encoding hardening**:
  - Uses strict percent-encoding for `options=-c ...` so Postgres parses DB-side timeouts reliably
- **Connection pool waiting cap**:
  - Derives `pool_max_waiting` default from pool size and overload multiplier (avoids unlimited waiting)

**Note:** These changes mitigate long-run CPU growth and timeout storms. Individual timed-out requests may still have underlying threads run to completion (known limitation; fix would require changes in mem0 upstream).

---

## Version 0.2.7 (2026-02-08)

### ⚡ Optimizations
- **Windowed incremental scans**:
  - Conversations are processed only within `[start_time, run_at]`, reducing over-scan and missed updates
- **Resume cursor accuracy**:
  - Resume cursors are set only when more pages exist, avoiding false max-conversation stops

### ✨ Enhancements
- **Checkpoint metadata tightening**:
  - Internal checkpoint markers are versioned and app scoping uses `agent_id=app_id`
- **Consistent checkpoint updates**:
  - Unified checkpoint update helpers normalize `created_at` and update ranges on empty/filtered conversations

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Avoid skip-by-last_run_at**:
  - Removed idempotency short-circuit to prevent missing messages when windows shift

---

## Version 0.2.6 (2026-02-07)

### ⚡ Optimizations
- **Extraction defaults tuned for daily runs**:
  - `days_back` default is now 1 (aligned with daily extraction cycles)
  - `conversations_limit` default is now 20 (aligned with 1-day extraction cycles)
  - Task status timestamps now use local time for clearer operational tracing

### ✨ Enhancements
- **Richer extraction status visibility**:
  - `check_extraction_status` now reports time range, duration, and processed vs scanned counts
  - Task status persists `range_start`/`range_end`, plus processed conversations/messages for diagnostics
- **Cleaner extraction writes**:
  - Extraction writes now pass `agent_id=app_id` for scoping
  - Metadata now tags `memory_origin` to distinguish implicit extraction
- **Task status storage isolation**:
  - Internal task status records use a dedicated user id (`memory_extractor`) and simplified filters
- **Safety & logging polish**:
  - Prompt guardrails prevent guessing IDs for update/delete actions
  - Dify runtime logging avoids duplicate propagation

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Resume-safe extraction at conversation limits**:
  - Checkpoints store resume cursors and defer task success when `max_conversations` is reached, preventing silent skips

---

## Version 0.2.5 (2026-02-04)

### 🛠️ Reliability & Compatibility Improvements

This release focuses on compatibility fixes for structured LLMs, safer client reuse for subtype extraction, and more robust Dify test tooling.

#### Highlights

- **LLM Compatibility Shim**:
  - Added `_parse_response` patch for structured providers (e.g., Azure structured) to improve tool-call parsing
  - Keepalive uses provider-agnostic `generate_response()` for broader model compatibility
- **Sync Subtype Client Reuse**:
  - Subtype clients accept config overrides to avoid manual Memory replacement
  - Pool-sharing logic keeps prompts isolated while reusing the base connection pool
- **Dify Tooling Stability**:
  - `DifyClient` enforces `/v1` base URL format to avoid ambiguous API paths
  - Cleanup script supports `DIFY_USER_IDS` and closes client resources after use

#### ⚠️ Notes

- **No breaking changes**: Existing configurations remain valid

## Version 0.2.4 (2026-02-03)

### 🔒 Resource Isolation Optimization for Long-Term Memory Tool

This release introduces critical resource isolation improvements for the `extract_long_term_memory` tool, ensuring efficient connection pool management and preventing resource leaks when processing multiple memory subtypes.

#### Highlights

- **🔒 Connection Pool Sharing & Resource Isolation**:
  - **Problem Solved**: The long-term memory extraction tool creates multiple subtype clients (semantic/episodic/procedural) for processing different memory types. Previously, each client would create its own connection pool, leading to resource waste and potential connection exhaustion.
  - **Solution**: Implemented intelligent connection pool sharing mechanism where all subtype clients share the base client's connection pool
  - **Resource Isolation**: Each subtype client maintains its own `Memory` instance with custom prompts for isolation, but shares the underlying connection pool for efficiency
  - **Impact**: Reduces database connections from 3 pools (one per subtype) to 1 shared pool, significantly improving resource efficiency

- **🛡️ Smart Resource Cleanup**:
  - **Pool Ownership Detection**: Added `_is_sharing_pool` flag to track which clients are sharing connection pools
  - **Prevent Premature Closure**: Resource cleanup logic now detects shared pools and only allows the owner (base client) to close them
  - **Automatic Cleanup Order**: Subtype clients are cleaned up first, then base client closes the shared pool
  - **Impact**: Prevents "connection pool already closed" errors and ensures proper resource lifecycle management

- **🔧 Implementation Details**:
  - `build_subtype_sync_clients()` and `build_subtype_async_clients()` now accept `base_client` parameter to share connection pool
  - `SyncMem0Client.close()` and `AsyncMem0Client.aclose()` check `_is_sharing_pool` flag before closing pools
  - `resource_cleanup.py` enhanced with pool sharing detection logic
  - All cleanup operations respect pool ownership to prevent race conditions

#### 📊 Resource Efficiency Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Connection Pools per Task | 3 (one per subtype) | 1 (shared) | **-67%** |
| Database Connections | 3x pool size | 1x pool size | **-67%** |
| Resource Leaks | Possible | Prevented | ✅ |
| Cleanup Errors | Possible | Eliminated | ✅ |

#### 📝 Files Changed

- **Modified Files**:
  - `utils/mem0_extraction.py` - Added connection pool sharing logic in `build_subtype_sync_clients()` and `build_subtype_async_clients()`
  - `utils/mem0_client.py` - Enhanced `close()` and `aclose()` methods with pool sharing detection
  - `utils/resource_cleanup.py` - Added pool sharing detection in `close_vector_store()` function
  - `tools/extract_long_term_memory.py` - Updated to pass base_client for pool sharing, improved cleanup order

#### ⚠️ Migration Notes

- **No Breaking Changes**: All changes are internal resource management improvements
- **No Configuration Changes**: No user-facing configuration changes required
- **Automatic**: Resource isolation improvements are automatically applied to all extraction tasks
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing checkpoints and task status storage

#### 🎯 Benefits

1. **Resource Efficiency**: 67% reduction in database connections per extraction task
2. **Prevents Resource Leaks**: Proper cleanup order ensures no orphaned connection pools
3. **Production Stability**: Eliminates connection pool exhaustion in high-concurrency scenarios
4. **Cost Savings**: Fewer database connections reduce infrastructure costs for large-scale deployments

## Version 0.2.1 (2026-01-29)

### 🔥 Critical Bug Fix: Data Loss Prevention

#### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed data loss issue when time range expands forward
  - **Issue**: When new `start_time` is earlier than last processed time, checkpoint causes early messages to be permanently skipped
  - **Example**: First run processes T2-T4, second run processes T1-T5, resulting in messages T1-T2 being lost
  - **Root Cause**: Reverse-order scanning + ID-based checkpoint stop logic cannot handle time range rollback
  - **Impact Scope**: Scenarios like backfilling historical data, time range adjustments, etc.
  - **Fix Solution**: Time range-aware Checkpoint mechanism

#### Enhanced
- **ConversationCheckpoint Enhancement**:
  - Added `processed_range_start`: Records the earliest processed message time
  - Added `processed_range_end`: Records the latest processed message time
  - Redundancy Impact: Each session increases by ~40 bytes (still very low)

- **Scanning Logic Optimization**:
  - Automatically detects time range forward expansion (`range_is_expanding`)
  - When expanding, does not stop at checkpoint, continues scanning earlier messages
  - Timestamp-priority stop logic (more reliable), ID-based as fallback
  - Fully backward compatible with old checkpoints (no range fields)

#### Testing
- Added test file: `tests/test_time_range_expansion.py`
  - Verifies time range forward expansion does not lose data
  - Verifies checkpoint stops normally when no range expansion
  - Verifies old checkpoint backward compatibility

#### Documentation
- Added detailed documentation: `.cursor/plans/checkpoint_data_integrity_fix.md`
  - Issue analysis, fix solution, test coverage, usage recommendations

#### Impact
- ✅ **No Message Loss**: Completely fixes data loss issue from time range rollback
- ✅ **No Message Duplication**: Checkpoint still effectively prevents duplicate processing
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Old checkpoints automatically migrate, no manual operation required
- ⭐ **Strongly Recommended Upgrade**: Fixes critical data integrity issue

  - Recommended to use Dify's `workflow_run_id` to link multiple memory operations in the same workflow
  - **Important**: `run_id` is only used for request tracing and logging; it is NOT used as a condition for memory layering or filtering
  - All tools now include request ID in logs for better traceability
  - Request ID format: `[req:<run_id>]` prefix in log messages
- **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed deprecated configuration fields from UI
  - Legacy `*_json` fields (e.g., `local_llm_json`, `local_embedder_json`) are no longer shown in configuration UI
  - Only `*_secret` fields (e.g., `local_llm_json_secret`, `local_embedder_json_secret`) are available for new installations
  - **Important**: If you encounter configuration issues after upgrade, please delete old credentials and reconfigure using the new `*_secret` fields
- **Code Quality Improvements**:
  - Improved logging with request ID tracking across all operations
  - Better error messages with context information
  - Optimized timeout handling with unified constants
  - Enhanced log messages with operation context

#### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Log Level Management**:
  - Added `set_log_level()` function in `utils/logger.py` for thread-safe log level updates
  - Module-level log level cache with thread-safe locking
  - Updates apply to all existing loggers in `tools.*` and `utils.*` modules
  - Provider validation automatically sets log level from credentials
- **Timeout Constants**:
  - Replaced individual timeout constants (`SEARCH_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`, `GET_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`, etc.) with unified constants
  - `READ_OPERATION_TIMEOUT: int = 15` for all read operations
  - `WRITE_OPERATION_TIMEOUT: int = 30` for all write operations
  - All tools use `parse_timeout()` helper for consistent timeout handling
- **Request Tracing**:
  - All tools extract `run_id` from `tool_parameters` (defaults to "no-run-id" if not provided)
  - Request ID included in all log messages: `logger.info("[req:%s] ...", request_id, ...)`
  - `run_id` is NOT included in Mem0 API payloads (only used for tracing)
  - Helps track operations across workflow execution chains
- **Configuration Schema**:
  - Removed legacy `*_json` fields from `provider/mem0ai.yaml`
  - Only `*_secret` fields are shown in configuration UI
  - Backward compatibility: code still supports legacy fields via `_get_credential_value()` fallback, but UI no longer displays them

#### ⚠️ Migration Notes

**🔴 CRITICAL: Credentials Configuration Incompatibility**

**⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE**: This version introduces **incompatible changes** to credentials configuration. You **MUST** delete old credentials before upgrading.

**Configuration Field Changes:**
- **Removed**: Legacy `*_json` fields (e.g., `local_llm_json`, `local_embedder_json`) are **completely removed** from the configuration UI
- **Removed**: `pgvector_min_connections` and `pgvector_max_connections` credential fields (v0.1.9+)
- **Required**: Only `*_secret` fields (e.g., `local_llm_json_secret`, `local_embedder_json_secret`) are available
- **Migration**: PGVector connection pool settings must now be configured in `local_vector_db_json_secret` JSON using `minconn` and `maxconn` (see [CONFIG.md](https://github.com/beersoccer/mem0_dify_plugin/blob/main/CONFIG.md#vector-store-configuration-local_vector_db_json_secret))

**Required Upgrade Steps:**
1. **Backup your configuration** (copy all credential values)
2. **Delete old credentials** in Dify UI: `Settings` → `Plugins` → `mem0ai` → `Delete Credentials`
3. **Upgrade the plugin** to v0.1.8+
4. **Reconfigure** using the new `*_secret` fields
5. **Migrate PGVector settings**: If you used `pgvector_min_connections`/`pgvector_max_connections`, add `minconn` and `maxconn` to your pgvector JSON config

**⚠️ If you skip deleting old credentials:**
- Plugin may fail to start
- "Internal Server Error" when accessing plugin settings
- Tools may not work correctly

For detailed upgrade instructions, see [README.md - Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/beersoccer/mem0_dify_plugin/blob/main/README.md#-upgrade-guide).

**Other Changes:**
- **Timeout Changes**: Read operation timeout reduced from 30s to 15s
- **New Features**: `log_level` can be changed online; `run_id` parameter for request tracing

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed inconsistent timeout handling across different read operations
- Improved error messages with request context for better debugging

#### 🎯 Performance Recommendations
1. **Use Dynamic Log Level**: Set `log_level` to DEBUG for troubleshooting, then switch back to INFO for production
2. **Request Tracing**: Use Dify's `workflow_run_id` as `run_id` parameter to track operations across workflow chains
3. **Timeout Tuning**: If 15s timeout is too short for your environment, consider using sync mode or adjusting timeout values

  - Added `track_bg_task()` method with automatic cleanup via callbacks
  - Added `get_pending_tasks_count()` method for queue monitoring
  - Tasks are automatically removed when completed (no manual cleanup needed)
- **Overload Protection Logic**:
  - Check: `pending_count > max_ops * MAX_PENDING_TASKS_MULTIPLIER` (default: 5x)
  - Action: Reject new write operations (add/update/delete/delete_all) when queue is full
  - Log: Warning with operation type and relevant ID (user_id or memory_id)
  - Response: Return error message indicating system overload
- **Credential Schema Changes**:
  - New fields: `local_llm_json_secret`, `local_embedder_json_secret`, `local_vector_db_json_secret`, `local_graph_db_json_secret`, `local_reranker_json_secret`
  - Legacy fields: `local_llm_json`, `local_embedder_json`, `local_vector_db_json`, `local_graph_db_json`, `local_reranker_json` (marked as DEPRECATED)
  - Added `_get_credential_value()` helper in `utils/config_builder.py` for fallback logic

#### ⚠️ Migration Notes
- **Upgrading from v0.1.3**: See [README.md - Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/beersoccer/mem0_dify_plugin/blob/main/README.md#-upgrade-guide) for detailed upgrade instructions and installation time optimization details.
- **Credential Migration**: 
  - **Code-level backward compatibility**: Code can read both old `*_json` and new `*_secret` fields
  - **UI-level change**: New `*_secret` fields are shown in UI, old `*_json` fields are hidden
  - **Recommended**: For cleanest upgrade, delete old credentials and reconfigure using `*_secret` fields
  - **Note**: v0.1.8+ removes old fields completely, so you must delete and reconfigure before upgrading to v0.1.8+
- **Performance Impact**: Write operations may be rejected when system is overloaded (queue > 5x concurrency limit)
- **Monitoring**: Watch for "Background task queue overloaded" warnings in logs

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed credential default value type errors: numeric defaults changed to strings to comply with Dify's `text-input` type requirements
- Fixed recurring indentation errors in tool files that caused `IndentationError` during plugin installation
- Improved credential upgrade compatibility: Code can read both old and new field names, but UI only shows new fields

#### 🎯 Performance Recommendations
1. **Monitor Queue Length**: Check logs for pending task counts
2. **Adjust Configuration**: If overload warnings are frequent:
   - Increase `max_concurrent_memory_operations` (current: 40, recommend > 20 for production)
   - Use faster models (cloud API instead of self-hosted models)
   - Reduce request rate or use sync mode for testing
3. **CPU Optimization**: The task tracking and overload protection significantly reduce CPU usage by preventing unbounded task accumulation

## Version 0.1.5 (2025-11-28)

### 🎯 Search Memory Timestamp Support & Code Refactoring

This release adds timestamp support to search results and refactors common utility functions into a centralized helpers module for better code maintainability.

#### Highlights
- **Search Memory Timestamp Support**: Added `timestamp` field to search results
  - Displays the most recent timestamp from `created_at` or `updated_at` fields
  - Format: `2025-11-03T20:06:27` (second precision, no milliseconds or timezone)
  - Only included in results when at least one timestamp is available
  - Logic: If both `created_at` and `updated_at` exist, returns the more recent one; if only one exists, returns that one; if both are empty, `timestamp` field is not included
- **Code Refactoring**: Created `utils/helpers.py` to centralize common utility functions
  - Abstracted `parse_timeout()` function for unified timeout parameter parsing
  - Abstracted `format_recent_timestamp()` and `parse_iso_timestamp()` for timestamp handling
  - Renamed `utils/timestamp.py` to `utils/helpers.py` for better naming (supports future utility functions)
- **Code Quality Improvements**:
  - Removed unused class imports (`LocalClient`, `AsyncLocalClient`) from all tool files
  - Changed `AsyncLocalClient.ensure_bg_loop()` to instance method call `client.ensure_bg_loop()`
  - Updated comments to remove direct references to `AsyncLocalClient.shutdown()`
  - Fixed indentation errors in multiple tool files (`add_memory.py`, `update_memory.py`, `delete_memory.py`, `delete_all_memories.py`)

#### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Timestamp Formatting**:
  - `format_recent_timestamp()` compares `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
  - Returns the most recent timestamp in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` format
  - Handles ISO8601 timestamp parsing with timezone support
  - Converts timestamps to local timezone before formatting
- **Helper Functions**:

## Version 0.1.4 (2025-11-23)

### 🔍 Logging Investigation & Documentation Update

This release documents logging-related investigations and discussions, with no code changes.

#### Highlights
- **Logging Issue Investigation**: Identified and documented logging output behavior
  - Discovered that logs may appear twice in command line output (JSON format from Dify plugin handler and standard format from Python root logger)
  - Identified Unicode encoding in JSON format logs (Chinese characters displayed as `\uXXXX` format)
  - Investigated potential solutions including disabling logger propagation and custom formatters
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated all markdown files to reflect current version and maintain consistency

#### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Logging Behavior Analysis**:
  - Dify's `plugin_logger_handler` outputs logs in JSON format: `{"event": "log", "data": {"level": "INFO", "message": "...", "timestamp": ...}}`
  - Python's root logger may also output logs in standard format: `INFO:tools.update_memory:...`
  - This can result in duplicate log output when logger propagation is enabled
  - JSON format uses `ensure_ascii=True` by default, causing Unicode characters to be encoded as `\uXXXX`
- **Investigation Notes**:
  - Considered setting `logger.propagate = False` to prevent duplicate logs
  - Considered custom formatter with standard format and timestamp
  - Current implementation uses Dify's official plugin logger handler as-is

#### ⚠️ Known Issues
- Logs may appear twice in command line output (JSON format + standard format)
- JSON format logs display Chinese characters as Unicode escape sequences (`\uXXXX`)
- These are framework-level behaviors from Dify's plugin logger handler

#### 📝 Notes
- No code changes in this release
- Documentation updated to maintain consistency across all markdown files
- Version number incremented to 0.1.4

---

## Version 0.1.3 (2025-11-22)

### 🎯 Logging, Configuration & Database Connection Pool Optimization

This release focuses on improving logging infrastructure, optimizing configuration handling, and enhancing database connection pool management for better production stability.

#### Highlights
- **Unified Logging Configuration**: Implemented centralized logging using Dify's official plugin logger handler (`plugin_logger_handler`) to ensure all logs are properly output to the Dify plugin container
  - Created `utils/logger.py` module with `get_logger()` function for consistent logger initialization
  - All Python modules now use the unified logger configuration
  - Logs are correctly routed to Dify's logging system for better debugging and monitoring
- **Constant Naming Optimization**: Renamed `MAX_CONCURRENT_MEM_ADDS` to `MAX_CONCURRENT_MEMORY_OPERATIONS` to accurately reflect its purpose
  - The constant controls concurrency for all async memory operations (search, add, get, get_all, update, delete, delete_all, history), not just add operations
  - Updated default value from 5 to 40 to support higher concurrency
- **Database Connection Pool Configuration**: Added automatic connection pool settings for pgvector
  - New constants: `PGVECTOR_MIN_CONNECTIONS` (10) and `PGVECTOR_MAX_CONNECTIONS` (40)
  - Connection pool settings are automatically applied when initializing pgvector if not explicitly provided
  - Pool size aligns with `MAX_CONCURRENT_MEMORY_OPERATIONS` to ensure sufficient database connections
- **PGVector Configuration Optimization**: Enhanced pgvector configuration handling according to Mem0 official documentation
  - Properly handles parameter priority: `connection_pool` (highest) > `connection_string` > individual parameters
  - Automatically builds `connection_string` from discrete parameters (dbname, user, password, host, port, sslmode)
  - Cleans up redundant connection parameters based on priority
  - Preserves all valid pgvector config keys (collection_name, embedding_model_dims, diskann, hnsw, etc.)

#### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Logging Infrastructure**:
  - Created `utils/logger.py` with `get_logger(name: str)` function
  - Uses `dify_plugin.config.logger_format.plugin_logger_handler` for proper log routing
  - All tool files, utility modules, and main.py updated to use unified logger
  - Prevents duplicate log handlers with `if not logger.handlers` check
- **Constants Updates**:
  - Renamed `MAX_CONCURRENT_MEM_ADDS` → `MAX_CONCURRENT_MEMORY_OPERATIONS` (default: 40)
  - Added `PGVECTOR_MIN_CONNECTIONS: int = 10`
  - Added `PGVECTOR_MAX_CONNECTIONS: int = 40`
- **PGVector Configuration**:
  - Updated `_normalize_pgvector_config()` to handle three connection methods with proper priority
  - Automatically sets `minconn` and `maxconn` if not provided in user configuration
  - Supports both `connection_string` and discrete parameter forms
  - Validates and preserves all official pgvector config keys

#### ⚠️ Migration Notes
- No breaking changes in API or behavior
- Constant name change: `MAX_CONCURRENT_MEM_ADDS` → `MAX_CONCURRENT_MEMORY_OPERATIONS` (internal only, no user impact)
- Connection pool settings are automatically applied to pgvector configurations
- If custom connection pool settings are needed, they can be explicitly set in pgvector config

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

## Version 0.1.2 (2025-11-21)

### 🎯 Configurable Timeout & Code Quality Improvements

This release introduces configurable timeout parameters for all read operations and optimizes default timeout values for better performance and reliability.

#### Highlights
- **Configurable Timeout Parameters**: All read operations (Search/Get/Get_All/History) now support user-configurable timeout values through the Dify plugin configuration interface
  - Timeout parameters are set as `form: form` (manual input), not exposed to LLM for inference
  - If not specified, tools use default values from `constants.py`
  - Allows users to customize timeout behavior per tool based on their specific needs
- **Optimized Default Timeouts**: Reduced default timeout values for better responsiveness:
  - `MAX_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: 120 seconds → **60 seconds**
  - `SEARCH_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`: 60 seconds → **30 seconds**
  - `GET_ALL_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`: 60 seconds → **30 seconds**
  - `GET_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`: 30 seconds → **30 seconds** (unchanged)
  - `HISTORY_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`: 30 seconds → **30 seconds** (unchanged)
- **Code Quality**: Added missing module and class docstrings, fixed formatting issues to comply with Python best practices

#### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Timeout Configuration**:
  - Added `timeout` parameter to `search_memory.yaml`, `get_all_memories.yaml`, `get_memory.yaml`, `get_memory_history.yaml`
  - Parameters are optional and use `form: form` (manual configuration, not LLM inference)
  - Tools read timeout from `tool_parameters.get("timeout")` and fall back to constants if not provided
  - Invalid timeout values are caught and logged with a warning, defaulting to constants
- **Default Timeout Values**:
  - All read operations now default to 30 seconds (previously 60s for Search/Get_All)
  - `MAX_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` reduced to 60 seconds for faster failure detection
- **Code Quality**:
  - Added module docstrings to all tool files
  - Added class docstrings to all tool classes
  - Fixed formatting issues (blank lines after class docstrings)

#### ⚠️ Migration Notes
- No breaking changes in API or behavior
- Default timeout values have changed (60s → 30s for Search/Get_All operations)
- Users can now configure custom timeout values per tool in the Dify plugin configuration interface
- If custom timeout values are needed, they should be set in the tool configuration

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed missing module and class docstrings in tool files
- Fixed formatting issues (missing blank lines after class docstrings)

## Version 0.1.1 (2025-11-20)

### 🎯 Production Stability & Timeout Protection

This release addresses critical production issues where tools would hang indefinitely, implementing comprehensive timeout mechanisms and service degradation strategies to ensure reliable operation in production environments.

#### Highlights
- **Timeout Protection**: Added timeout mechanisms for all async read operations (Search/Get/Get_All/History) to prevent indefinite hanging
  - Search Memory: 60 seconds timeout
  - Get All Memories: 60 seconds timeout
  - Get Memory: 30 seconds timeout
  - Get Memory History: 30 seconds timeout
- **Service Degradation**: When operations timeout or encounter errors, the plugin gracefully degrades by:
  - Logging the event with full exception details
  - Cancelling background tasks to prevent resource leaks
  - Returning default/empty results (empty list `[]` for Search/Get_All/History, `None` for Get)
  - Ensuring Dify workflow continues execution without interruption
- **Robust Error Handling**: Enhanced exception handling to catch all error types (network errors, connection failures, SSL errors, etc.), not just specific exceptions
- **Resource Management**: Improved background task cancellation on timeout using `future.cancel()` to prevent hanging tasks and resource leaks

#### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Timeout Implementation**:
  - Added timeout constants in `utils/constants.py`: `SEARCH_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`, `GET_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`, `GET_ALL_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`, `HISTORY_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`
  - Applied timeouts to `future.result(timeout=...)` calls in all async read operations
  - Used `concurrent.futures.TimeoutError` (aliased as `FuturesTimeoutError`) for correct exception handling
  - **Note**: Sync mode has no timeout protection (blocking calls). If timeout protection is needed, use `async_mode=true`
- **Service Degradation**:
  - All tools now initialize result variables with default values before `try` blocks
  - Timeout handlers call `future.cancel()` to prevent background tasks from hanging
  - Exception handlers catch all `Exception` types, not just specific ones
  - Tools return empty/default results on any error to ensure workflow continuity
- **Unified Exception Handling**:
  - Removed redundant outer `except FuturesTimeoutError` blocks (sync mode doesn't throw this exception)
  - Unified exception handling pattern: async mode handles timeout and general exceptions, sync mode handles general exceptions only
  - Both modes implement service degradation (return default/empty results) to ensure workflow continuity
- **Code Quality**:
  - Ensured `ensure_bg_loop()` guarantees a long-lived, reusable event loop
  - Added comprehensive documentation for timeout and service degradation mechanisms
  - Improved error logging with `logger.exception` for detailed stack traces
  - Simplified code structure by removing duplicate exception handling blocks

#### ⚠️ Migration Notes
- No breaking changes in API or behavior
- Tools now have timeout protection, which may cause operations to return empty results if they exceed timeout limits
- Workflows should handle empty results gracefully (which they already should)
- Production environments will benefit from improved stability and reliability

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed production issue where `Search memory` tool would hang indefinitely without proper termination
- Fixed issue where tools would fail without proper error handling, causing workflow interruptions
- Fixed resource leaks from hanging background tasks after timeouts

## Version 0.1.0 (2025-11-19)

### 🎯 Smart Memory Management & Robustness

This release transforms the `add_memory` tool into a smart memory manager and significantly improves the plugin's stability by handling edge cases and race conditions.

#### Highlights
- **Smart Memory Management**: The `add_memory` tool description has been updated to reflect its true capability. It leverages Mem0's intelligence to automatically decide whether to add, update, or delete memories based on user interaction context.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Operations on non-existent memories (Get/Update/Delete) now return clear, friendly error messages instead of crashing with internal Python exceptions.
- **Race Condition Protection**: Implemented a multi-layer defense mechanism for `update` and `delete` operations to handle concurrent modifications safely.

#### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Tool Updates**:
  - `add_memory`: Updated YAML description to emphasize intelligent memory management (Add/Update/Delete).
  - `get_all_memories`: Fixed a bug where results were empty due to incorrect parsing of Mem0's dictionary response format.
  - `get_memory`: Added checks for `None` results to prevent `AttributeError`.
  - `update_memory` / `delete_memory`: Added pre-checks and internal `try-except` blocks to catch `AttributeError` caused by Mem0's internal race conditions when operating on deleted memories.
- **Documentation**:
  - Added "Important Notes" section in README/GUIDE about `delete_all` triggering "Resetting index" warnings (normal behavior).
  - Clarified vector store connection settings for Debug vs Production modes.

#### ⚠️ Migration Notes
- No breaking changes in API.
- `add_memory` tool description is updated, but the tool name and label remain "Add Memory".

## Version 0.0.9 (2025-11-17)

### 🎯 Unified Return Format & Enhanced Async Operations

This release focuses on standardizing tool outputs and extending non-blocking async behavior to all write operations.

#### Highlights
- **Unified JSON Return Structure**:
  - All tools now return consistent format: `{"status": "SUCCESS/ERROR", "messages": {...}, "results": {...}}`
  - `status`: Operation status (SUCCESS or ERROR)
  - `messages`: Context information (query params, filters, IDs, etc.)
  - `results`: Actual data (memories, history, operation results)
  
- **Enhanced Async Operations**:
  - Write operations (Add/Update/Delete/Delete_All) are now non-blocking in async mode
  - Return ACCEPT messages immediately: `UPDATE_ACCEPT_RESULT`, `DELETE_ACCEPT_RESULT`, `DELETE_ALL_ACCEPT_RESULT`
  - Read operations (Search/Get/Get_All/History) always wait for results
  
- **Standardized Return Fields**:
  - Search/Get/Get_All: `id`, `memory`, `metadata`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - History: `memory_id`, `old_memory`, `new_memory`, `event`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `is_deleted`
  - Removed redundant fields: `hash`, `user_id`, `agent_id`, `run_id` from individual memory objects
  
- **Extended Constants** (`utils/constants.py`):
  - Added `UPDATE_ACCEPT_RESULT`: `{"message": "Memory update has been accepted"}`
  - Added `DELETE_ACCEPT_RESULT`: `{"message": "Memory deletion has been accepted"}`
  - Added `DELETE_ALL_ACCEPT_RESULT`: `{"message": "Batch memory deletion has been accepted"}`
  
- **Complete Documentation**:
  - All methods in `LocalClient` and `AsyncLocalClient` now have comprehensive docstrings
  - Consistent parameter descriptions and return value documentation
  - Clear async vs sync behavior documentation

#### Technical Details
- **Async Mode Behavior**:
  - When `async_mode=true` (default):
    - Add/Update/Delete/Delete_All: Submit to background loop without waiting, return ACCEPT status
    - Search/Get/Get_All/History: Wait for results via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe().result()`
  - When `async_mode=false`:
    - All operations use `LocalClient` and block until completion
    
- **Error Handling**:
  - All error responses include `"results": []` for consistency
  - Exception types unified: `(ValueError, RuntimeError, TypeError)`

#### Migration Notes
- Tool outputs now use `status` instead of `event` for top-level status indicator
- If your workflow parses tool outputs, update to use the new field names
- Async write operations now return ACCEPT messages instead of actual results

---

## Version 0.0.8 (2025-11-11)

- Add async_mode provider credential (default true) with clear runtime behavior
- Tools route to LocalClient/AsyncLocalClient based on async_mode for all operations
- Provider validation aligns with async_mode
- Docs updated (README/INSTALL/GUIDE/manifest) to reflect async vs sync behavior

## Version 0.0.7 (2025-11-08)

### 🚀 Self-hosted mode, async client, graceful shutdown

This release focuses on stability, self-hosted mode operation, and developer ergonomics.

#### Highlights
- Centralized constants in `utils/constants.py`:
  - `MAX_CONCURRENT_MEMORY_OPERATIONS` (default: 5, renamed from MAX_CONCURRENT_MEM_ADDS)
  - `SEARCH_DEFAULT_TOP_K` (default: 5)
  - `MAX_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (default: 120)
  - Shared response shapes: `ADD_SKIP_RESULT`, `ADD_ACCEPT_RESULT`
  - `CUSTOM_PROMPT` for memory distillation (optional)
- Background event loop:
  - Single process-wide loop created once and reused
  - Tools dispatch async operations via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(...)`
- Graceful shutdown:
  - `AsyncLocalClient.shutdown()` drains pending tasks briefly and stops the loop
  - Registered via `atexit` and SIGTERM/SIGINT in `main.py`
- Non-blocking add:
  - `AddMem0Tool` enqueues add and returns immediately with `{"status": "queued", ...}`
  - Skips empty/blank messages with `{"status": "skipped", "reason": "no messages", ...}`
- Search improvements:
  - Executes on the background loop
  - Returns normalized JSON and a detailed text message for downstream nodes

#### Removals/Cleanups
- SaaS mode and API version parameters removed
- Deprecated `run_async_task` and background task tracking removed
- Input validation for empty messages centralized in tool layer
